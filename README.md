Child Prescription History
 

Medical History has always been an important part of diagnosis. Your new doctor would prescribe medication better if he knows the prescription you have been taking in the past. 
Keeping record of prescription specifically in todayâ€™s busy life is hell of a task. When it comes to children medical history becomes more important if by any means you have lost the previous record; Diagnosis becomes a little difficult. We developed Child Prescription History application that will help the parents to store the medical records of their children.
